# Group Project Documentation

# For this group project the group and I decided to aspire to have a more
of an improvisation approach allowing for space and the exploration of new
melodic and rhythmic elements to be known come the time for performance. We
created a shared google doc listing code and sounds that we enjoyed using during
our trial run of a set.

#Stratgey
With this performance we decided to start of with percussion, a basic beat,
build upon that and then return to the simpleness of how we started to
conclude the performance. During the performance we plan to add sounds
as needed, communicate with each other, and really feel things out as we go.

# Problems Faced
I think at times we would run into sounds that didn't work well with each other
whether there was a distortion or a clash with certain frequencies
or even rhythmically/melodically some sounds didn't mesh well together,  
although as intuitive beings I believe we found our way trusting in our ears
as well as our ability to navigate the performance and make things work. I felt
our communication was well but also our unspoken communication seemed to be really
good too. Throughout the dress rehearsal if you will we had moments where we
were piecing code together that worked and expressions
and gestures were confirmation enough.
